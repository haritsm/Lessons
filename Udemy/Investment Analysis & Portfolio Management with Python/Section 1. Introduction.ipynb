    "# Course FAQs\n",
    "We love questions that push the intellectual boundaries. Questions that change the way we think. And those that help us reach new heights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those questions, we encourage you to ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some questions are very basic and common however, and answering these places a great burden on the limited resources Fervent has.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please read these FAQs before proceeding to take the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Credentials and relevance related questions\n",
    "- **Who teaches this course?**\n",
    "    - The course is designed and delivered by Vash, who holds an MPhil (Scholar) (WBS) in Finance and Econometrics, MSc (Scholar) (Exon) in Finance and Accounting, and BSc (BA, per tradition) (Hons) (Exon) in Business and Accounting from Russell Group Universities (Warwick & Exeter, UK).\n",
    "    - He has over 9 years of professional training and teaching experience, with clients including Associates at Big 4 Accounting / Audit firms, Finance Directors at SMEs, as well as University / College students at the Undergraduate, Postgraduate, and MBA levels. Vash has a track record of consistently delivering student-centric content and simplifying complex concepts in an engaging and constructive manner.\n",
    "    - His current research involves assessing the impact of trust on market pricing, working with a rich set of 'Big Data' and applying a variety of methodologies including (but not limited to) applications of Natural Language Processing (NLP) in both supervised and unsupervised machine learning, factor modelling, and event studies.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Is the course relevant for my University / College course on Finance?**\n",
    "    - The Finance related course content is relevant for most Ivy League / Russell Group Universities. You should check your module handbook (aka course handbook, module outline, course outline) to make sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions relating to Pre-requisites\n",
    "- **Do I need to know how to code?**\n",
    "    - Yes, coding knowledge is required and assumed, but you do not need to be an expert in Python to take the course.\n",
    "    - Even though we explain each line of code step by step, the course is designed on the assumption that you know how to code.\n",
    "    - Specifically, at a minimum, we assume you know the difference between lists, tuples, and dictionaries in terms of data structures. We also assume you know the difference between strings, integers, and floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **I don't know how to code, but still want to learn Investment Analysis & Portfolio Management - can I achieve that in this course?**\n",
    "    - If you don't know how to code, but still want to learn Investment Analysis & Portfolio Management, we recommend enrolling on our sister course, \"Investment Analysis & Portfolio Management - Core Finance\". That course teaches the same concepts, albeit on ExcelÂ® and Google Sheets instead of Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Will you teach me how to setup Python?**\n",
    "    - No, because we assume you already have it setup, since we assume you know how to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Can you recommend a Python course so I can learn to code?**\n",
    "    - Unfortunately, no. Fervent cannot verify nor vouch for courses where we do not control the learning experience design and delivery end-to-end.\n",
    "    - Fervent has great respect for Corey Schafer and Sentdex who both provide credible, valuable content on YouTube for aspiring programmers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Do I need to know Financial concepts or Statistics?**\n",
    "    - No. Knowledge of Finance is not required. Knowledge of statistics is useful but not essential.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions relating to support\n",
    "- **My code throws an error, even though I've done exactly what's shown in the video.**\n",
    "    - Please use the code provided in the Resources folder, and compare the results. Oftentimes, it can look like your code is identical, but there might be a very small, hard to notice syntax error which can cause an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **I'm having technical issues with video or sound, who do I contact?**\n",
    "    - Please contact Udemy directly via support@udemy.com as this is something only they can help with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **How do I get my certificate of completion?**\n",
    "    - Please see instructions from Udemy here: https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us/articles/229603868-Certificate-of-Completion\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **I've completed the course, but it still says I haven't finished it.**\n",
    "    -Please contact Udemy directly via support@udemy.com along with screenshots of your progress, as this is something only they can help with.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Do you provide personal or corporate training?**\n",

    "- Access to financial data can be quite expensive. Fortunately, there are some free alternatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Accessing Financial Data Manually\n",
    "- You can access data manually from Yahoo! Finance here: http://finance.yahoo.com\n",
    "- Alternatively, you can access it from Google Finance by opening a Google Sheets document at http://sheets.google.com/ and using the \"GOOGLEFINANCE\" function.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Accessing Financial Data Programatically\n",
    "Pandas Datareader\n",
    "\n",
    "- Accessing data via Python's Pandas Datareader has known issues and is not very reliable at this point in time. That is why we do not use it in the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other sources\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are other reliable, and really useful sources of financial data available via API calls, such that the data can be loaded programatically into Python.\n",
    "- Unfortunately, we cannot mention those sources nor display them in the course due to copyright restrictions and ambiguity. We spoke with the API providers but did not get a clear, unambiguous response about whether or not we can display them in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data in this course\n",
    "- All of the data in this course is obtained from Yahoo! Finance and / or Google Sheets.\n",
    "- Throughout the course, you'll have access to the datasets we use in the videos as csv files.\n",
    "- Note that in the real world, it is very uncommon for people to download data from Yahoo! Finance or Google Sheets when coding in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "While we will give you data to work with in the course, we strongly recommend working with your own datasets. This will help you better apply what you learn, and also deal with data cleaning / \"data wrangling\" effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To find relevant APIs which we cannot name, search \"financial and alternative data api python\" on Google."
