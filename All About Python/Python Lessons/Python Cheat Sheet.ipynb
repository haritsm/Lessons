    "Since it's not always easy to decide how to best tell the story behind your data, we've broken the chart types into three broad categories to help with this.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trends - A trend is defined as a pattern of change.\n",
    "    - sns.lineplot - Line charts are best to show trends over a period of time, and multiple lines can be used to show trends in more than one group.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Relationship - There are many different chart types that you can use to understand relationships between variables in your data.\n",
    "    - sns.barplot - Bar charts are useful for comparing quantities corresponding to different groups.\n",
    "    - sns.heatmap - Heatmaps can be used to find color-coded patterns in tables of numbers.\n",
    "    - sns.scatterplot - Scatter plots show the relationship between two continuous variables; if color-coded, we can also show the relationship with a third categorical variable.\n",
    "    - sns.regplot - Including a regression line in the scatter plot makes it easier to see any linear relationship between two variables.\n",
    "    - sns.lmplot - This command is useful for drawing multiple regression lines, if the scatter plot contains multiple, color-coded groups.\n",
    "    - sns.swarmplot - Categorical scatter plots show the relationship between a continuous variable and a categorical variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Distribution - We visualize distributions to show the possible values that we can expect to see in a variable, along with how likely they are.\n",
    "    - sns.distplot - Histograms show the distribution of a single numerical variable.\n",
    "    - sns.kdeplot - KDE plots (or 2D KDE plots) show an estimated, smooth distribution of a single numerical variable (or two numerical variables).\n",
    "    - sns.jointplot - This command is useful for simultaneously displaying a 2D KDE plot with the corresponding KDE plots for each individual variable"
